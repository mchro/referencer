Referencer
==========
    A document organiser and bibliography manager
	https://github.com/mchro/referencer
        (Previous homepage: http://icculus.org/referencer/)

Original author: John Spray (jcspray at icculus.org)
Current best-effort maintainer: Mads Chr. Olesen (mads at mchro.dk)

Building
========

Builds using meson.
A simple 'meson builddir && meson compile -C builddir/' should build the referencer executable, if the dependencies are present.

The build dependencies are:
	g++
	poppler-glib
	gtkmm-3.0
	boost_regex
	intltool
	python
	python API


On Ubuntu 22.04:
	sudo apt-get install build-essential libpoppler-glib-dev libgtkmm-3.0-dev libboost-dev intltool python2-dev libboost-regex-dev

Installing
==========

Referencer may be run in-place from the build directory (type `builddir/referencer`)
for convenient evaluation or testing.  Alternatively, it maybe installed
systemwide: running 'meson install -C builddir' should install Referencer into the 
/usr/local prefix by default.
